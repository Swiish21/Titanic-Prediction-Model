# Titanic Machine Learning Project

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts whether passengers from the Titanic dataset survived or not. The model is trained using various features from the dataset, and the performance is evaluated using standard metrics.

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd titanic-ml-project
   ```

2. Install the required dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

1. Perform exploratory data analysis using the Jupyter notebook:
